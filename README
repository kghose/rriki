RRiki (Ruby Research Wiki) is software that can be used to keep notes and organize references for research. 
RRiki runs on your local computer via a webbrowser. You can add, edit and search through your notes from 
within your webbrowser much like you would access a wiki (such as wikipedia). You can get detailed 
information about RRiki from the project wiki.
